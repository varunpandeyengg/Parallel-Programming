# Parallel-Programming
A repository that has some interesting parallel implementation. Mainly pTheads, MPI, OpenMP and CUDA

Why Go Parallel? 
The evolution of computers has witnessed a dramatic change in the last two decades. From the self induced competitiveness of Moore's law to hitting the power wall and finally, the new age of multicore processors. The new ramifications of processor technology namely - High performance processors (Xeon), GPGPUs and low power processors (ARM/Atom), are implicitly parallel. I strongly believe that a computer scientist/engineer must have a good understanding of underlying system. More so, it is even better if we can exploit the parallel computation resources for better performance.

This is one of the prime factors that enticed me towards Parallel Programming.
